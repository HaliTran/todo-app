# To-Do Application

A very basic to-do application that allows users to add tasks to their to-do list, check off tasks, and delete tasks.
This application was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The main purpose of this was to learn and better
understand the fundamentals of Javascript such as DOM traversal, searching, creation, and browser event (bubbling and capturing). Furthermore, it was to help solidify the concepts of CSS flexbox and the nuances that that layout provides.
